## The Repository

This repository implements the EMNLP'23 paper "We are Who We Cite: Bridges of Influence Between Natural Language Processing and Other Academic Fields"

## Getting Started

### Data

First, you need  to download a recent dump from Semantic Scholar. Therefore, set your API key under `YOUR_API_KEY`, and request the following two endpoints:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/datasets/v1/release/2023-01-03/dataset/citations' \
--header 'x-api-key: ${YOUR_API_KEY}' \
-o citations/citations.json
```

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/datasets/v1/release/2023-01-03/dataset/papers' \
--header 'x-api-key: ${YOUR_API_KEY}' \
-o papers/papers.json
```

Next, execute the following command to download the entire dataset.
> Note: This will take up significant space 108G+ for papers and 534G+ for citations compressed.

```bash
python3 src/download.py
```

### Pre-Processing

To convert the dataset into [Apache Spark's](https://spark.apache.org) native format which increases processing speeds significantly, execute:

```bash
python3 src/preprocess.py
```

### Analysis

To reproduce the analysis, execute:
>Note: Because some operations require filtering and joining millions of papers, they can take sometimes 24h+. You can choose which functions to run in the main() function.

```bash
python3 src/analysis.py
```
